### [H-1] Global timer for Snow.earnSnow() prevents multiple users from earning Snow tokens (Access Control + DoS)

**Description:** 
The `earnSnow()` function uses a single global timer `s_earnTimer` that affects all users. When any user calls `earnSnow()`, it prevents all other users from calling the function for one week. This breaks the intended functionality where each user should be able to earn one Snow token per week independently.

**Impact:** 
Only one user per week can earn free Snow tokens across the entire protocol, preventing all other users from accessing this core feature and enabling griefing attacks.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// Day 0: Alice calls earnSnow()
function earnSnow() external canFarmSnow {
    // s_earnTimer = 0, so check passes
    _mint(msg.sender, 1); // Alice gets 1 token
    s_earnTimer = block.timestamp; // Global timer set
}

// Day 1: Bob calls earnSnow() 
function earnSnow() external canFarmSnow {
    if (s_earnTimer != 0 && block.timestamp < (s_earnTimer + 1 weeks)) {
        revert S__Timer(); // ❌ Bob's call reverts
    }
    // Bob gets nothing, has to wait because of Alice's timer
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Replace the global timer with a per-user mapping


### [H-2] Users can lose ETH when attempting to buy Snow.buySnow() with incorrect payment amounts (Logic Error + Fund Loss)

**Description:** 
The `buySnow()` function has flawed payment logic that can cause users to lose their ETH. If a user sends ETH but not the exact required amount, the function keeps their ETH and then attempts to charge them again via WETH transfer. This can result in double charging or fund loss when the WETH transfer fails.

**Impact:** 
Users lose ETH permanently when sending incorrect amounts, face double charging (paying both ETH and WETH), and can have funds trapped in the contract due to failed WETH transfers.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// Scenario: s_buyFee = 1 ether, user wants 1 Snow token
function buySnow(1) external payable { // User sends 0.5 ETH by mistake
    if (msg.value == (s_buyFee * 1)) { // 0.5 ether != 1 ether
        // This branch skipped
    } else {
        // Contract keeps the 0.5 ETH the user sent
        i_weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), 1 ether);
        // Also takes 1 ETH worth of WETH from user
        _mint(msg.sender, 1);
        // User paid 1.5 ETH total (0.5 ETH + 1 WETH) for 1 token
    }
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Implement proper payment method validation and refund excess ETH.


### [H-3] No Access Control on Snowman.mintSnowman() Allows Unlimited NFT Minting (Missing Access Control + Fund/Protocol Breaking)

**Description:** 
The `mintSnowman()` function in Snowman.sol has no access control restrictions, allowing any user to mint unlimited Snowman NFTs to any address. This completely breaks the intended tokenomics where NFTs should only be minted through the SnowmanAirdrop contract when users stake Snow tokens.

**Impact:** 
Complete protocol failure. Attackers can mint unlimited NFTs, making them worthless and breaking the staking/airdrop mechanism. Total loss of protocol integrity.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity

function test_UnlimitedMinting() public {
   address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
   vm.prank(attacker);
   snowman.mintSnowman(attacker, 1000000); // Mint 1M NFTs for free
   assertEq(snowman.balanceOf(attacker), 1000000);
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation**
Add access control to ensure only the SnowmanAirdrop contract can mint:


### [H-4] Arbitrary transferFrom in SnowmanAirdrop Allows Token Theft (Input Validation + Fund Drain)

**Description:** 
The `claimSnowman()` function uses user-controlled `receiver` parameter in `safeTransferFrom(receiver, address(this), amount)`, allowing attackers to drain any user's Snow tokens by setting `receiver` to victim addresses.

**Impact:** 
Direct fund theft. Attackers can steal Snow tokens from any user who has approved the airdrop contract or has sufficient balance.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity 
function test_ArbitraryTransferFrom() public {
    // Alice has 1 Snow token and approves airdrop
    vm.prank(alice);
    snow.approve(address(airdrop), 1);
    
    // Attacker steals Alice's tokens by using her as receiver
    bytes32 digest = airdrop.getMessageHash(alice);
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(alKey, digest);
    
    vm.prank(satoshi); // Attacker transaction
    airdrop.claimSnowman(alice, AL_PROOF, v, r, s);
    
    // Alice's tokens stolen, she gets NFT but lost tokens
    assertEq(snow.balanceOf(alice), 0);
    assertEq(snow.balanceOf(address(airdrop)), 1);
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
 Enforce that only `msg.sender` can transfer their own tokens


 ### [H-5] MESSAGE_TYPEHASH Typo Breaks All Signature Verification (Typo + Signature Bypass)

**Description:** 
 The `MESSAGE_TYPEHASH` constant contains a typo: `"SnowmanClaim(addres receiver, uint256 amount)"` is missing the 's' in "address". This causes all EIP-712 signature verification to fail as the hash won't match user-signed messages.

**Impact:** 
 Complete airdrop system failure. No user can successfully claim through signature verification, making the entire signature-based claiming mechanism non-functional.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Fix the typo - 
```solidity 
bytes32 private constant MESSAGE_TYPEHASH = keccak256("SnowmanClaim(address receiver, uint256 amount)");
```

### [H-6] Reentrancy in Snowman.mintSnowman() Allows Extra NFT Minting (Reentrancy + Token Inflation)

**Description:** 
The `mintSnowman()` function is vulnerable to reentrancy via the `_safeMint()` callback to `onERC721Received()`. State variables are updated after the external call, allowing malicious contracts to reenter and mint additional NFTs.

**Impact:** 
Attackers can mint more NFTs than intended, diluting the NFT supply and breaking the 1:1 Snow token to NFT ratio.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// PoC - (Need malicious contract with onERC721Received)
contract MaliciousReceiver {
    function onERC721Received(...) external returns (bytes4) {
        if (attackCount < 3) {
            snowman.mintSnowman(address(this), 2); // Reenter
            attackCount++;
        }
        return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Use ReentrancyGuard or follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

### [M-1] Re-entrancy Snow.collectFee() vulnerability in fee collection allows potential exploitation (Re-entrancy)

**Description:** 
The `collectFee()` function uses a low-level call to transfer ETH to the collector without re-entrancy protection. This gives control to the collector contract during execution, potentially allowing re-entrancy attacks if the collector is a malicious contract.

**Impact:** 
Potential for re-entrancy attacks if collector is a malicious contract.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// If collector is a malicious contract, it can re-enter during ETH transfer:
// collectFee() → ETH sent to collector → collector calls collectFee() again
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Implement re-entrancy protection and follow checks-effects-interactions pattern.


### [M-2] Transaction atomicity Snow.collectFee() issue causes fee collection failures (State Management)

**Description:** 
In `collectFee()`, if the WETH transfer succeeds but the ETH transfer fails, the entire transaction reverts. This can lead to situations where fee collection repeatedly fails due to ETH transfer issues, even when WETH transfer would succeed.

**Impact:** 
Fee collection can be permanently blocked if ETH transfer consistently fails.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// If WETH transfer succeeds but ETH transfer fails (collector rejects ETH):
// WETH gets rolled back due to require() failure, no fees collected at all
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Handle WETH and ETH transfers independently.


### [M-3] No Double-Claim Protection in SnowmanAirdrop (Missing Validation + Double Spending)

**Description:**  
The `claimSnowman()` function sets `s_hasClaimedSnowman[receiver] = true` but never checks this mapping before processing claims, allowing users to potentially claim multiple times.

**Impact:** 
Users could claim NFTs multiple times if they can generate multiple valid signatures, leading to unfair distribution and NFT inflation.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
function test_DoubleClaim() public {
    // Alice claims successfully
    vm.prank(alice);
    snow.approve(address(airdrop), 1);
    
    bytes32 digest = airdrop.getMessageHash(alice);
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(alKey, digest);
    
    vm.prank(satoshi);
    airdrop.claimSnowman(alice, AL_PROOF, v, r, s);
    
    // Vulnerability: No check for s_hasClaimedSnowman[receiver] before processing
    // Function sets the flag but never checks it first
    assertTrue(airdrop.getClaimStatus(alice)); // Already claimed but no protection
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Add double-claim check


### [M-4] DoS via Unbounded Loop in Snowman.mintSnowman() (Resource Exhaustion + DoS)

**Description:** 
The `mintSnowman()` function contains a user-controlled loop with external calls `(_safeMint)`, allowing attackers to cause out-of-gas errors by providing large `amount` values.

**Impact:** 
Function becomes unusable with large inputs, preventing legitimate minting operations and potentially locking the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**
```solidity
// PoC 
function test_DoSAttack() public {
    vm.expectRevert(); // Expect out of gas
    snowman.mintSnowman(address(this), type(uint256).max);
}
```
**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Add reasonable limits


### [M-5] Unchecked Transfer Return Value in Snow.collectFee() (Unchecked Return + Silent Failure)

**Description:** 
The `collectFee()` function ignores the return value of `i_weth.transfer()`, causing silent failures if the WETH transfer fails while continuing to execute the rest of the function.

**Impact:** 
Collected fees could be permanently lost if WETH transfer fails, resulting in financial loss for the protocol.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Check return value or use SafeERC20

### [M-6] Missing Merkle Root Validation in Constructor (Input Validation + Deployment Risk)

**Description:** 
The SnowmanAirdrop constructor accepts `_merkleRoot` parameter without validating it's not zero, potentially allowing deployment with an invalid merkle root that would make all proofs fail.

**Impact:** 
If deployed with zero merkle root, the entire airdrop system becomes non-functional as all merkle proofs would be invalid.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Add validation in constructor

### [L-1] Incorrect Event Emission in Snowman.mintSnowman() (Logic Error + Integration Issues)

**Description:** 
The `SnowmanMinted` event parameter is named `numberOfSnowman` (suggesting count) but emits `s_TokenCounter` (token ID), creating semantic confusion and breaking off-chain integrations expecting count data.

**Impact:**
Broken off-chain integrations, misleading analytics, and poor user experience as dApps expecting mint counts receive token IDs instead.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Either emit count or rename parameter.


### [L-2] Missing event emission in Snow.earnSnow() function reduces transparency (Event Emission)

**Description:** 
The `earnSnow()` function does not emit an event when tokens are earned, unlike `buySnow()` which emits a `SnowBought` event. This inconsistency makes it difficult to track earning activities off-chain.

**Impact:** 
Reduced transparency and auditability.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Add event emission to earnSnow().

### [L-3] Snow.sol Contract can collect accidental ETH transfers as fees (Unintended Fund Collection)

**Description:** 
The `collectFee()` function transfers all ETH in the contract to the collector using `address(this).balance`, including any ETH accidentally sent directly to the contract address. This ETH was not paid as fees for Snow tokens but gets collected as if it were.

**Impact:** 
Users who accidentally send ETH to the contract lose their funds and collector receives funds that weren't legitimate fees.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Track legitimate fees separately from accidental transfers.
