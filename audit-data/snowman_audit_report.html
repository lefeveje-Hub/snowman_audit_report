<h1 id="protocol-summary">Protocol Summary</h1>
<p>The Snowman Merkle Airdrop protocol is a token distribution system
that combines ERC20 tokens (Snow), ERC721 NFTs (Snowman), and Merkle
tree-based airdrops. Users can earn or purchase Snow tokens, which can
then be staked in the SnowmanAirdrop contract to receive proportional
Snowman NFTs. The protocol features a 12-week farming period where users
can earn free Snow tokens weekly or purchase them with ETH/WETH. The
airdrop system utilizes Merkle proofs for efficient distribution and
supports signature-based claiming on behalf of others.</p>
<p><strong>Key Components:</strong> - <strong>Snow.sol</strong>: ERC20
token with buy/earn mechanics and fee collection -
<strong>Snowman.sol</strong>: ERC721 NFT with on-chain Base64 encoding -
<strong>SnowmanAirdrop.sol</strong>: Merkle tree-based airdrop system
with signature verification</p>

<strong>Duration:</strong> 2 days</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>The following contracts were in scope for this audit:</p>
<pre><code>src/

</ul>
<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This audit identified <strong>6 High severity</strong>, <strong>6
Medium severity</strong>, and <strong>3 Low severity</strong>
vulnerabilities across the three contracts in the Snowman Merkle Airdrop
protocol. The most critical issues involve missing access controls that
allow unlimited NFT minting, fund theft through arbitrary token
transfers, and broken signature verification due to a typo in the
EIP-712 hash.</p>
<p>The protocol’s core functionality is severely compromised by these
vulnerabilities, particularly the unrestricted minting capability that
completely breaks the tokenomics model. Immediate remediation of High
severity findings is strongly recommended before any mainnet
deployment.</p>

id="h-1-global-timer-for-snow.earnsnow-prevents-multiple-users-from-earning-snow-tokens-access-control-dos">[H-1]
Global timer for Snow.earnSnow() prevents multiple users from earning
Snow tokens (Access Control + DoS)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>earnSnow()</code> function
uses a single global timer <code>s_earnTimer</code> that affects all
users. When any user calls <code>earnSnow()</code>, it prevents all
other users from calling the function for one week. This breaks the
intended functionality where each user should be able to earn one Snow
token per week independently.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Only one user per week can earn free Snow
tokens across the entire protocol, preventing all other users from
accessing this core feature and enabling griefing attacks.RetryClaude
can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>// Day 0: Alice calls earnSnow()
function earnSnow() external canFarmSnow {
    // s_earnTimer = 0, so check passes
    _mint(msg.sender, 1); // Alice gets 1 token
    s_earnTimer = block.timestamp; // Global timer set
}

// Day 1: Bob calls earnSnow() 
function earnSnow() external canFarmSnow {
    if (s_earnTimer != 0 &amp;&amp; block.timestamp &lt; (s_earnTimer + 1 weeks)) {
        revert S__Timer(); // ❌ Bob&#39;s call reverts
    }
    // Bob gets nothing, has to wait because of Alice&#39;s timer
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Replace the global timer
with a per-user mapping</p>
<h3
id="h-2-users-can-lose-eth-when-attempting-to-buy-snow.buysnow-with-incorrect-payment-amounts-logic-error-fund-loss">[H-2]
Users can lose ETH when attempting to buy Snow.buySnow() with incorrect
payment amounts (Logic Error + Fund Loss)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>buySnow()</code> function has
flawed payment logic that can cause users to lose their ETH. If a user
sends ETH but not the exact required amount, the function keeps their
ETH and then attempts to charge them again via WETH transfer. This can
result in double charging or fund loss when the WETH transfer fails.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users lose ETH permanently when sending
incorrect amounts, face double charging (paying both ETH and WETH), and
can have funds trapped in the contract due to failed WETH transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>// Scenario: s_buyFee = 1 ether, user wants 1 Snow token
function buySnow(1) external payable { // User sends 0.5 ETH by mistake
    if (msg.value == (s_buyFee * 1)) { // 0.5 ether != 1 ether
        // This branch skipped
    } else {
        // Contract keeps the 0.5 ETH the user sent
        i_weth.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), 1 ether);
        // Also takes 1 ETH worth of WETH from user
        _mint(msg.sender, 1);
        // User paid 1.5 ETH total (0.5 ETH + 1 WETH) for 1 token
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Implement proper payment
method validation and refund excess ETH.</p>
<h3
id="h-3-no-access-control-on-snowman.mintsnowman-allows-unlimited-nft-minting-missing-access-control-fundprotocol-breaking">[H-3]
No Access Control on Snowman.mintSnowman() Allows Unlimited NFT Minting
(Missing Access Control + Fund/Protocol Breaking)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>mintSnowman()</code> function
in Snowman.sol has no access control restrictions, allowing any user to
mint unlimited Snowman NFTs to any address. This completely breaks the
intended tokenomics where NFTs should only be minted through the
SnowmanAirdrop contract when users stake Snow tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Complete protocol failure. Attackers can
mint unlimited NFTs, making them worthless and breaking the
staking/airdrop mechanism. Total loss of protocol integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>
function test_UnlimitedMinting() public {
   address attacker = makeAddr(&quot;attacker&quot;);
   vm.prank(attacker);
   snowman.mintSnowman(attacker, 1000000); // Mint 1M NFTs for free
   assertEq(snowman.balanceOf(attacker), 1000000);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation</strong> Add access control to ensure
only the SnowmanAirdrop contract can mint:</p>
<h3
id="h-4-arbitrary-transferfrom-in-snowmanairdrop-allows-token-theft-input-validation-fund-drain">[H-4]
Arbitrary transferFrom in SnowmanAirdrop Allows Token Theft (Input
Validation + Fund Drain)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>claimSnowman()</code>
function uses user-controlled <code>receiver</code> parameter in
<code>safeTransferFrom(receiver, address(this), amount)</code>, allowing
attackers to drain any user’s Snow tokens by setting
<code>receiver</code> to victim addresses.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Direct fund theft. Attackers can steal Snow
tokens from any user who has approved the airdrop contract or has
sufficient balance.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>function test_ArbitraryTransferFrom() public {
    // Alice has 1 Snow token and approves airdrop
    vm.prank(alice);
    snow.approve(address(airdrop), 1);
    
    // Attacker steals Alice&#39;s tokens by using her as receiver
    bytes32 digest = airdrop.getMessageHash(alice);
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(alKey, digest);
    
    vm.prank(satoshi); // Attacker transaction
    airdrop.claimSnowman(alice, AL_PROOF, v, r, s);
    
    // Alice&#39;s tokens stolen, she gets NFT but lost tokens
    assertEq(snow.balanceOf(alice), 0);
    assertEq(snow.balanceOf(address(airdrop)), 1);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Enforce that only
<code>msg.sender</code> can transfer their own tokens</p>
<p>### [H-5] MESSAGE_TYPEHASH Typo Breaks All Signature Verification
(Typo + Signature Bypass)</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>MESSAGE_TYPEHASH</code>
constant contains a typo:
<code>"SnowmanClaim(addres receiver, uint256 amount)"</code> is missing
the ‘s’ in “address”. This causes all EIP-712 signature verification to
fail as the hash won’t match user-signed messages.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Complete airdrop system failure. No user can
successfully claim through signature verification, making the entire
signature-based claiming mechanism non-functional.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Fix the typo -</p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>bytes32 private constant MESSAGE_TYPEHASH = keccak256(&quot;SnowmanClaim(address receiver, uint256 amount)&quot;);</code></pre>
<h3
id="h-6-reentrancy-in-snowman.mintsnowman-allows-extra-nft-minting-reentrancy-token-inflation">[H-6]
Reentrancy in Snowman.mintSnowman() Allows Extra NFT Minting (Reentrancy
+ Token Inflation)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>mintSnowman()</code> function
is vulnerable to reentrancy via the <code>_safeMint()</code> callback to
<code>onERC721Received()</code>. State variables are updated after the
external call, allowing malicious contracts to reenter and mint
additional NFTs.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Attackers can mint more NFTs than intended,
diluting the NFT supply and breaking the 1:1 Snow token to NFT
ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>// PoC - (Need malicious contract with onERC721Received)
contract MaliciousReceiver {
    function onERC721Received(...) external returns (bytes4) {
        if (attackCount &lt; 3) {
            snowman.mintSnowman(address(this), 2); // Reenter
            attackCount++;
        }
        return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Use ReentrancyGuard or
follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.</p>
<h3
id="m-1-re-entrancy-snow.collectfee-vulnerability-in-fee-collection-allows-potential-exploitation-re-entrancy">[M-1]
Re-entrancy Snow.collectFee() vulnerability in fee collection allows
potential exploitation (Re-entrancy)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>collectFee()</code> function
uses a low-level call to transfer ETH to the collector without
re-entrancy protection. This gives control to the collector contract
during execution, potentially allowing re-entrancy attacks if the
collector is a malicious contract.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Potential for re-entrancy attacks if
collector is a malicious contract.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>// If collector is a malicious contract, it can re-enter during ETH transfer:
// collectFee() → ETH sent to collector → collector calls collectFee() again</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Implement re-entrancy
protection and follow checks-effects-interactions pattern.</p>
<h3
id="m-2-transaction-atomicity-snow.collectfee-issue-causes-fee-collection-failures-state-management">[M-2]
Transaction atomicity Snow.collectFee() issue causes fee collection
failures (State Management)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In <code>collectFee()</code>, if the
WETH transfer succeeds but the ETH transfer fails, the entire
transaction reverts. This can lead to situations where fee collection
repeatedly fails due to ETH transfer issues, even when WETH transfer
would succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Fee collection can be permanently blocked if
ETH transfer consistently fails.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>// If WETH transfer succeeds but ETH transfer fails (collector rejects ETH):
// WETH gets rolled back due to require() failure, no fees collected at all</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Handle WETH and ETH
transfers independently.</p>
<h3
id="m-3-no-double-claim-protection-in-snowmanairdrop-missing-validation-double-spending">[M-3]
No Double-Claim Protection in SnowmanAirdrop (Missing Validation +
Double Spending)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />
The <code>claimSnowman()</code> function sets
<code>s_hasClaimedSnowman[receiver] = true</code> but never checks this
mapping before processing claims, allowing users to potentially claim
multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users could claim NFTs multiple times if
they can generate multiple valid signatures, leading to unfair
distribution and NFT inflation.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>function test_DoubleClaim() public {
    // Alice claims successfully
    vm.prank(alice);
    snow.approve(address(airdrop), 1);
    
    bytes32 digest = airdrop.getMessageHash(alice);
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(alKey, digest);
    
    vm.prank(satoshi);
    airdrop.claimSnowman(alice, AL_PROOF, v, r, s);
    
    // Vulnerability: No check for s_hasClaimedSnowman[receiver] before processing
    // Function sets the flag but never checks it first
    assertTrue(airdrop.getClaimStatus(alice)); // Already claimed but no protection
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Add double-claim check</p>
<h3
id="m-4-dos-via-unbounded-loop-in-snowman.mintsnowman-resource-exhaustion-dos">[M-4]
DoS via Unbounded Loop in Snowman.mintSnowman() (Resource Exhaustion +
DoS)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>mintSnowman()</code> function
contains a user-controlled loop with external calls
<code>(_safeMint)</code>, allowing attackers to cause out-of-gas errors
by providing large <code>amount</code> values.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Function becomes unusable with large inputs,
preventing legitimate minting operations and potentially locking the
contract.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept:</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>// PoC 
function test_DoSAttack() public {
    vm.expectRevert(); // Expect out of gas
    snowman.mintSnowman(address(this), type(uint256).max);
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Add reasonable limits</p>
<h3
id="m-5-unchecked-transfer-return-value-in-snow.collectfee-unchecked-return-silent-failure">[M-5]
Unchecked Transfer Return Value in Snow.collectFee() (Unchecked Return +
Silent Failure)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>collectFee()</code> function
ignores the return value of <code>i_weth.transfer()</code>, causing
silent failures if the WETH transfer fails while continuing to execute
the rest of the function.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Collected fees could be permanently lost if
WETH transfer fails, resulting in financial loss for the protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Check return value or use
SafeERC20</p>
<h3
id="m-6-missing-merkle-root-validation-in-constructor-input-validation-deployment-risk">[M-6]
Missing Merkle Root Validation in Constructor (Input Validation +
Deployment Risk)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The SnowmanAirdrop constructor accepts
<code>_merkleRoot</code> parameter without validating it’s not zero,
potentially allowing deployment with an invalid merkle root that would
make all proofs fail.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> If deployed with zero merkle root, the
entire airdrop system becomes non-functional as all merkle proofs would
be invalid.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Add validation in
constructor</p>
<h3
id="l-1-incorrect-event-emission-in-snowman.mintsnowman-logic-error-integration-issues">[L-1]
Incorrect Event Emission in Snowman.mintSnowman() (Logic Error +
Integration Issues)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>SnowmanMinted</code> event
parameter is named <code>numberOfSnowman</code> (suggesting count) but
emits <code>s_TokenCounter</code> (token ID), creating semantic
confusion and breaking off-chain integrations expecting count data.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Broken off-chain integrations, misleading
analytics, and poor user experience as dApps expecting mint counts
receive token IDs instead.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Either emit count or rename
parameter.</p>
<h3
id="l-2-missing-event-emission-in-snow.earnsnow-function-reduces-transparency-event-emission">[L-2]
Missing event emission in Snow.earnSnow() function reduces transparency
(Event Emission)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>earnSnow()</code> function
does not emit an event when tokens are earned, unlike
<code>buySnow()</code> which emits a <code>SnowBought</code> event. This
inconsistency makes it difficult to track earning activities
off-chain.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced transparency and auditability.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Add event emission to
earnSnow().</p>
<h3
id="l-3-snow.sol-contract-can-collect-accidental-eth-transfers-as-fees-unintended-fund-collection">[L-3]
Snow.sol Contract can collect accidental ETH transfers as fees
(Unintended Fund Collection)</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The <code>collectFee()</code> function
transfers all ETH in the contract to the collector using
<code>address(this).balance</code>, including any ETH accidentally sent
directly to the contract address. This ETH was not paid as fees for Snow
tokens but gets collected as if it were.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Users who accidentally send ETH to the
contract lose their funds and collector receives funds that weren’t
legitimate fees.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Mitigation:</strong> Track legitimate fees
separately from accidental transfers.</p>
